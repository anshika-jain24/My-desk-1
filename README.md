# MyDesk - Your productivity tool


## Introduction
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, education has shifted to online mode. From classes to exams, everything is happening online. It has been a difficult transition.
A student now has a lot of class materials in soft copy. Assignments, class notes, and other resources have to be organized constantly, or it becomes overwhelming to sort through documents. Also one may need to access these documents from various devices.
<br><br>
Since classes are held online, students cannot connect with their peers as easily, and the co-learning environment with discussions and accountability is lost to them.
So we have developed a collaborative solution in the form of a web application where students can store all their work related and personal documents all at one place in an organised manner. 



## Current Features of MyDesk:

### Todo List: 
It's a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do. Make it fast to add and organize tasks. Ideally, a task is added and categorized in a couple taps or keystrokes.

### Virtual Storage Space:
This is the most important and the main highlighting feature of our app. It is divided into two sections:
1. College/School Related Work - It helps you store all your assignments, tests, notes, books divided by category so that you can browse them easily when needed.
2. Personal Documents - It helps you to store all your personal documents like your medical reports, identity documents, etc reducing all the stress of losing them.

### Group Study: 
A place where you can connect with your friends and share your notes/assignments and study together all at one place.

### A Calendar:
Keeps track of all the upcoming tasks and helps you remember things easily.
